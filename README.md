ABSTRACT

We as a group identified a problem of patients finding it difficult to consult doctors 
at the consultation room and long waiting times at Meru university hospital located
at Nchiru. Our project mainly focuses on designing a hospital booking system tailored
for Meru university, aimed at making it easier for patients to book appointments and
improved healthcare service delivery. The system addresses challenges such as long 
waiting times and manual scheduling errors. The methodology involves requirements 
analysis, system design and development using modern web technologies such as PHP
(Hypertext preprocessor) to create a user friendly platform. The keyfindings show that the system minimizes scheduling conflicts, reduces administrative workload and enhances patient
Satisfaction. Conclusion highlights system’s potential to improve healthcare access for students 
and staff.

















INTRODUCTION

The hospital booking system platform is designed to streamline patient appointment
Management and improve healthcare service delivery. The hospital booking system
Comes with Electronic Health Records, SMS notification after booking an appointment
And reminders to reduce missing of appointments. Objectives and goals of the project 
are as follows:1)To enhance accessibility through a website.
		2)To reduce manual paperwork and administrative workload.
		3)To improve appointment efficiency for students and staff.
The relevance of this project to computer technology is that patients are able to book
appointments via websites using hardwares such as phones and laptops.















PROBLEM STATEMENT

The current hospital booking system entirely depends on manual appointment scheduling.
The manual appointment scheduling leads to problems such as:
1)long waiting times due to overcrowding and unstructured booking processes.
2)There is double bookings and scheduling errors – manual appointment
Scheduling increases risk of overlapping appointments, causing frustration for both
Patients and healthcare providers as they are responsible for scheduling appointments.
3)Time consuming – patients have to visit the hospital in person so as to  be scheduled 
at what time to meet a doctor and if any tests are to be done as guided by the doctor.
These challenges negatively impact patient satisfaction and prefer going to other hospitals
Which make them pay hospital bills yet they can get free medication at the school hospital.
This problem is worth solving because the hospital booking system will:
1)positively impact patients satisfaction.
2)reduce administrative workload.
3)enhance healthcare efficiency.









METHODOLOGY
1.	Approach
The project aims to design a hospital booking system to streamline appointment scheduling
For patients of Meru university. The agile methodology was used to ensure iterative 
Development, continuous feedback from people and adaptability to user needs. We set
Some objectives which would guide us in solving the problem.
1.	Tools and materials
We used tools such as github where we created an account and used the frontend: React.js
Backend: Node. Js with express. Js, Database: Firebase (for real time updates) and Design:
Figma(UI/UX prototyping) and materials such as laptops for development of the website.
1.	steps in the project execution
a)	Conducted interviews with Meru university health center staff and students.
b)	Identified that there are long queues near the consultation room and there is
No online booking.
C)	Created wireframes for UI/UX
D)	Designed database(patient records, appointments and doctor’s schedules)
e)Built frontend(React.js/flutter) for responsive design.
f)Developed backend APIs(Node.js) for appointment booking and notifications.
g)Implemented SMS for appointment reminders.
h)We tested and gathered feedback from students and staff.
4.critical thinking strategies
a)Analyzing assumptions
The assumption is that students prefer a website over a mobile app as apps may fill their
Storage in the phone.We interviewed students and found that they prefer a website over
An app.
b)Evaluating evidence
Data from healthcare providers say that patients show up late in the nights and yet they
Stay far and optimized the system that one can be escorted by an ambulance.
a)	Considering alternative solutions
Problem:No-shows for appointments
Solution:SMS reminders
a)	Reflecting on outcomes
After testing, users suggested for modification of the system to allow a same day bookings
Which would be ideal for urgent needs.

5)	Impact on decision making
Feedback from users influenced us as a group to consider the modification of the system
To allow a same day bookings and decided to implement it on the system which would
also enable those with urgent needs to be attended to if there is an open slot.


6) IMPLEMENTATION

The hospital
booking System was implemented using an 
iterative development model ensuring
Continuous feedback and improvements.
We Conducted
interviews with the university health
Stuff and
Students

We identified needs such as the online appointment
booking real-time scheduling and automated reminders.
We designed a web-based application with the fronted, small backend, and we will use the school database.

Frontend :Developed usinq HTML, CSS and javascipt
Backerd NODE.JS
Database My SQL for Structured
patient records, appoitments and doctor schedules

Student will be able to access the booking system through student portal
We also placed login portl for students to login
Automated Confirmation SMS notificotion
We verified individual modules (login,booking & hotifications)

User Acceptance testing Faedback from a pilot
Students and Statf.

Some of the challenges we faced ond how we
Overcame them:
